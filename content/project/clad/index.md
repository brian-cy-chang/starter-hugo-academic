title: Center for Linkage and Acquistion of Data
summary: The All of Us Center for Linkage and Acquisition of Data (CLAD) expands the types and research utility of program data available to researchers through passive data streams. CLAD acquires and processes linked data within a secure platform before delivering it to the All of Us Data and Research Center. The CLAD team is also responsible for developing analytical tools to help researchers jumpstart their analyses when using the linked data.

Within CLAD, I am part of the Geospatial-Geocoding team, where I develop data pipelines to prepare residential history of US addresses for input to geocoders and assist in evaluating geocoder performance metrics. Our goal in the Geospatial team is to link All of US participants' residential history to Environmental Justice Index ([EJI]) to study the impact of social determinants of health longitudinally.
