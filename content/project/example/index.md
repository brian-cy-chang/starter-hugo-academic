Since June 2020, the Synthetic Data Validation Task Team has sought to evaluate the utility of N3C synthetic data. So far, the task team has one manuscript accepted and another undergoing revisions through their work evaluating the utility of synthetic data across three use cases. Members of the task team, including myself, will be presenting our work together as a panel discussion at the AMIA 2021 Annual Symposium. Work is ongoing on other utility analyses. Our efforts are also expanding into privacy evaluations of the same datasets assessed for their utility so that we can quantify privacy-utility tradeoffs.
