title: Ensembling segmentation methods to detect vertebral bodies on radiographs

event: National Library of Medicine (NLM) T15 Training Conference

  city: Stanford
  region: CA
  postcode: '94305'
  country: United States

summary: This presentation discusses an ensemble method of segmentation models to detect the approximate location of VBs and maximize the number of true positives on lateral thoracic and lumbar radiographs of the spine. Such a model could play a crucial role in an automated opportunistic screening tool of osteoporosis via detection of vertebral compression fractures.

# abstract: This panel discusses the use of synthetic data for various real analyses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a synthetic dataset derived from N3C data, panelists have performed studies of data characterization, epidemic measurement, prevalence prediction, and inpatient severity prediction, and compared the data to results drawn from the original dataset. The panel provides a comprehensive review of how synthetic data can be used for analysis. While each of the studies could be considered separately, the combination of studies together creates an opportunity to clearly recognize the status of synthetic data validation, which can better advance the appropriate application of the technology in informatics broadly.
