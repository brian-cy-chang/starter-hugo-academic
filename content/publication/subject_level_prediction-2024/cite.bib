	abstract = {Automated screening for vertebral fractures could improve outcomes. We achieved an AUC-ROC = 0.968 for the prediction of moderate to severe fracture using a GAM with age and three maximal vertebral body scores of fracture from a convolutional neural network. Maximal fracture scores resulted in a performant model for subject-level fracture prediction. Combining individual deep learning vertebral body fracture scores and demographic covariates for subject-level classification of osteoporotic fracture achieved excellent performance (AUC-ROC of 0.968) on a large dataset of radiographs with basic demographic data.},
