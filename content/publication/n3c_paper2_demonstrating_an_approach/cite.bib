	abstract = {Objective To evaluate whether synthetic data derived from a national COVID-19 data set could be used for geospatial and temporal epidemic analyses.Materials and Methods Using an original data set (n=1,854,968 SARS-CoV-2 tests) and its synthetic derivative, we compared key indicators of COVID-19 community spread through analysis of aggregate and zip-code level epidemic curves, patient characteristics and outcomes, distribution of tests by zip code, and indicator counts stratified by month and zip code. Similarity between the data was statistically and qualitatively evaluated.Results In general, synthetic data closely matched original data for epidemic curves, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Synthetic data suppressed labels of zip codes with few total tests (mean=2.9{\textpm}2.4; max=16 tests; 66\% reduction of unique zip codes). Epidemic curves and monthly indicator counts were similar between synthetic and original data in a random sample of the most tested (top 1\%; n=171) and for all unsuppressed zip codes (n=5,819), respectively. In small sample sizes, synthetic data utility was notably decreased.Discussion Analyses on the population-level and of densely-tested zip codes (which contained most of the data) were similar between original and synthetically-derived data sets. Analyses of sparsely-tested populations were less similar and had more data suppression.Conclusion In general, synthetic data were successfully used to analyze geospatial and temporal trends. Analyses using small sample sizes or populations were limited, in part due to purposeful data label suppression -an attribute disclosure countermeasure. Users should consider data fitness for use in these cases.Competing Interest StatementAll authors have completed the ICMJE uniform disclosure form at http://www.icmje.org/downloads/coi_disclosure.docx and declare: Authors JAT, ABW, RF, and PP received financial support from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through grant number U24TR002306 disbursed to their affiliated institutions for the submitted work; author NZ is an employee of MDClone; this manuscript underwent National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) publication review described at https://covid.cd2h.org/publication-review; the institution RF and PP are affiliated with (Washington University in St. Louis) is a customer of MDClone; all authors declare no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.Funding StatementAuthors JAT, ABW, RF, and PP received financial support from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, National Institutes of Health, through grant number U24TR002306 disbursed to their affiliated institutions for the submitted work.
