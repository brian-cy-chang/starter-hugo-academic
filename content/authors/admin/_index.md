Accomplished business leader and innovator at the intersection of data science & artificial intelligence, medical informatics, and organizational data strategy. I have 12+ years experience in medicine ranging from non-profit executive leadership, frontline healthcare delivery, observational & interventional research, analysis/modeling of real-world data to new product introduction R&D. In just 2.5 years of work in the medical devices industry, I have driven innovation and led lean teams to generate outsized business value through the application of data science and AI methods, and have had a similarly outsized impact on shaping broader data strategy with senior management.

In my prior roles as a researcher before and during my PhD, I published 16 and 4 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings, respectively, over a six year time span. I wrote a $1.75 million R01 grant on EHR data quality based on 1/3 of my dissertation research with my [PhD advisor, Adam Wilcox](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O6GOa0AAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) that was scored in the top 38th percentile. I previously maintained many acadmic affiliations prior to moving into industry. These included serving on the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association [(JAMIA) student editorial board (2019-2021)](https://web.archive.org/web/20200620122644/https://academic.oup.com/jamia/pages/Editorial_Board) under the mentorship of [NEI director Mike Chiang](https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/nei-leadership/michael-f-chiang-md) then [full editorial board (2021-2023)](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119055542/https://academic.oup.com/jamia/pages/Editorial_Board), the [2021 AMIA Annual Symposium Scientific Committee](https://web.archive.org/web/20220706155014/https://amia.org/education-events/amia-2021-annual-symposium/scientific-program-committee), [National Covid Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Synthetic Data Validation Workstream](https://web.archive.org/web/20220128204111/https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C_synthetic_data), [Cascadia Data Alliance](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/about/about-the-hutch/institutional-partners-collaborations/cascadia-data-alliance.html), [National Research Network for Audit Log Data](https://cliir.ucsf.edu/portfolio/national-research-network-ehr-audit-log-data) and more.

My main foci at Philips currently are 1) building foundational layers (data, infrastructure, knowledge representation, talent, culture) to support biomedical data science & AI and 2) applying data science & AI methods on data to drive business value and improve patient outcomes.
